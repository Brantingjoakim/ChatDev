As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The code looks well-structured and follows the regulations mentioned. However, there is one potential improvement that can be made to enhance the user experience.

In the `solve_problem` method of the `CouplesCounselingApp` class, after retrieving the solution for the given problem and attachment style, it would be helpful to display a message if no solution is found. Currently, it returns a generic message, but it would be more informative to let the user know that no solution is available for the specific problem and attachment style combination.

To implement this improvement, you can modify the `solve_problem` method in the `CouplesCounselingApp` class as follows:

```python
def solve_problem(self):
    problem = self.problem_entry.get()
    attachment_style = self.attachment_style_var.get()
    solution = self.problem_solver.solve_problem(problem, attachment_style)
    if solution == "No solution found for the given problem and attachment style.":
        solution = f"No solution found for the problem '{problem}' and attachment style '{attachment_style}'."
    self.solution_text.delete(1.0, tk.END)
    self.solution_text.insert(tk.END, solution)
```

This change will provide more specific feedback to the user when no solution is found for a particular problem and attachment style combination.

Once you make this modification, the code will be ready for use.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code looks well-structured and follows the regulations mentioned. However, there is one potential improvement that can be made to enhance the user experience.

In the `solve_problem` method of the `CouplesCounselingApp` class, after retrieving the solution for the given problem and attachment style, it would be helpful to display a message if no solution is found. Currently, it returns a generic message, but it would be more informative to let the user know that no solution is available for the specific problem and attachment style combination.

To implement this improvement, you can modify the `solve_problem` method in the `CouplesCounselingApp` class as follows:

```python
def solve_problem(self):
    problem = self.problem_entry.get()
    attachment_style = self.attachment_style_var.get()
    solution = self.problem_solver.solve_problem(problem, attachment_style)
    if solution == "No solution found for the given problem and attachment style.":
        solution = f"No solution found for the problem '{problem}' and attachment style '{attachment_style}'."
    self.solution_text.delete(1.0, tk.END)
    self.solution_text.insert(tk.END, solution)
```

This change will provide more specific feedback to the user when no solution is found for a particular problem and attachment style combination.

Once you make this modification, the code will be ready for use."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

<Comment>
The code follows most of the regulations mentioned, but there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `solve_problem` method of the `ProblemSolver` class, the code checks if the `attachment_style` is in `self.solutions`, but it does not handle the case when the `problem` is not in `self.solutions[attachment_style]`. This can lead to a KeyError if an invalid problem is entered.

To fix this, you can add an additional check to see if the problem exists in the solutions dictionary for the given attachment style. If it does not exist, you can return a default message indicating that no solution was found for the given problem and attachment style.

Here's the revised code for the `solve_problem` method in `problem_solver.py`:

```python
def solve_problem(self, problem, attachment_style):
    if attachment_style in self.solutions and problem in self.solutions[attachment_style]:
        return self.solutions[attachment_style][problem]
    else:
        return "No solution found for the given problem and attachment style."
```

Please make this change to ensure that the code handles cases where an invalid problem is entered.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The code follows most of the regulations mentioned, but there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `solve_problem` method of the `ProblemSolver` class, the code checks if the `attachment_style` is in `self.solutions`, but it does not handle the case when the `problem` is not in `self.solutions[attachment_style]`. This can lead to a KeyError if an invalid problem is entered.

To fix this, you can add an additional check to see if the problem exists in the solutions dictionary for the given attachment style. If it does not exist, you can return a default message indicating that no solution was found for the given problem and attachment style.

Here's the revised code for the `solve_problem` method in `problem_solver.py`:

```python
def solve_problem(self, problem, attachment_style):
    if attachment_style in self.solutions and problem in self.solutions[attachment_style]:
        return self.solutions[attachment_style][problem]

In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT> The code is well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `solve_problem` method of the `ProblemSolver` class, the code checks if the `attachment_style` exists in the `self.solutions` dictionary and if the `problem` exists in the corresponding attachment style's dictionary. If either of these conditions is not met, it returns "No solution found for the given problem and attachment style.".

To improve the code, I suggest adding a check to see if the `attachment_style` exists in the `self.solutions` dictionary. If it doesn't, the code can return a message indicating that the attachment style is not supported. This will provide more informative feedback to the users.

Here's the revised code for the `solve_problem` method in the `ProblemSolver` class:

```python
def solve_problem(self, problem, attachment_style):
    if attachment_style not in self.solutions:
        return f"Attachment style '{attachment_style}' is not supported."
    elif problem in self.solutions[attachment_style]:
        return self.solutions[attachment_style][problem]
    else:
        return f"No solution found for the problem '{problem}' and attachment style '{attachment_style}'."
```

Please make this change in the `problem_solver.py` file and ensure that all the regulations mentioned earlier are followed.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT> The code is well-structured and follows the given requirements. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

In the `solve_problem` method of the `ProblemSolver` class, the code checks if the `attachment_style` exists in the `self.solutions` dictionary and if the `problem` exists in the corresponding attachment style's dictionary. If either of these conditions is not met, it returns "No solution found for the given problem and attachment style.".

To improve the code, I suggest adding a check to see if the `attachment_style` exists in the `self.solutions` dictionary. If it doesn't, the code can return a message indicating that the attachment style is not supported. This will provide more informative feedback to the users.

Here's the revised code for the `solve_problem` method in the `ProblemSolver` class:

```python
def solve_problem(self, problem, attachment_style):
    if attachment_style not in self.solutions:
        return f"Attachment style '{attachment_style}' is not supported."
    elif problem in self.solutions[attachment_style]:
        return self.solutions[attachment_style][problem]
    else:
        return f"No solution found for the problem '{problem}' and attachment style '{attachment_style}'."
```

Please make this change in the `problem_solver.py` file and ensure that all the regulations mentioned earlier are followed."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided codes and the fact that the application is developed using Python, the requirements.txt file should include the necessary dependencies for the project. In this case, the project does not have any external dependencies beyond the standard library modules.

Therefore, the requirements.txt file for this project would be empty as there are no additional packages or libraries required.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided codes and the fact that the application is developed using Python, the requirements.txt file should include the necessary dependencies for the project. In this case, the project does not have any external dependencies beyond the standard library modules.
Therefore, the requirements.txt file for this project would be empty as there are no additional packages or libraries required. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly."

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:
